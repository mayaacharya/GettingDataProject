## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

In this project, I summarized **motion data**. 

## Code

All of the code I used is condensed into one script: **run_analysis.r**.
This script loads all the data from the test and train folders, isolates only the *mean* and *standard deviation* data, and summarizes that data by subject.
